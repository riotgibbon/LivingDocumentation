LivingDocumentation
===================

Tools for creating Living Documentation from Specifications by Example - http://specificationbyexample.com/

Currently only supporting Java/JBehave and Target Process

Create features and scenarios, tag them with matching entity id values from Target Process, automatically export the results of the test



The Problem
===========
Different members of the team (product owners, developers, QA) all have different ideas of what the application is supposed to do, and how.

Documentation, if it even exists, is vague and out of date.

Unit tests are only accessible and readable by developers
